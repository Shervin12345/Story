//Version Control Using Git and the Command line
// initialize git with "git init" -> you cant see the file but with "ls -a" you can see all the hidden files
// Staging area (intermediate place) -> you can see whats inside with "git status" -> so far git is only in the working directory but not in the staging area
   Add Chapter 1 to the staging area with "git add chapter1.txt" (in order to add all file you can use "git add .")
// Make commit with "git commit -m "NAME"; you can see information about your commit with "git log"
// git diff chapter3.txt to see the difference between the last version and the current version
// "git checkout" - get to the previous version
